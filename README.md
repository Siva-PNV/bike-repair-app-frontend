# Bike Repair Platform

This is a full-stack web application to connect bike riders with nearby mechanics. Riders can search for nearby repair shops, send requests, and mechanics can receive notifications and respond. The frontend uses React (Vite). Backend setup (Node.js/Express/MongoDB) will follow.

## Getting Started

### Frontend
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend
- Backend setup instructions will be added soon.

## Features
- Rider and mechanic registration/login
- Geolocation-based search for mechanics
- Request and notification system
